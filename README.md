Assignment: Lab 1

Takes a file input of doubles and outputs the first, second, second to last, and last doubles.

I used the cite cplusplus.com to view a tutorial on input and output files to refresh my memory and get started with this code.
I also used the referce page of "std::istream::seekg" on cpulsplus.com to learn and understand how to use the seekg method and tellg method.

Annoyingly the second to last number is only accurate if there is no whitespace after the last double in the txt file. I couldn't figure out a solution to this problem.
